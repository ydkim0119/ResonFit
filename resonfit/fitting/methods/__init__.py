Fitting methods for superconducting resonator S21 data.

Available Methods:
-----------------
- DCM (Diameter Correction Method): For analyzing asymmetric resonance line shapes
- Inverse: Inverse S21 Method for alternative fitting approach
- CPZM (Closest Pole and Zero Method): For analyzing resonator data with a different parameterization
