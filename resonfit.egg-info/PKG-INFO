# ResonFit

A modular Python package for analyzing and fitting superconducting resonator S21 data.

## Overview

ResonFit provides a comprehensive and extensible framework for analyzing S21 transmission data from superconducting microwave resonators. It is designed to be modular and flexible, allowing users to customize their analysis pipeline while providing sensible defaults based on established methods.

## Features

- üìä **Data Preprocessing**
  - Cable delay correction
  - Amplitude and phase normalization

- üîç **Fitting Methods**
  - DCM (Diameter Correction Method)

- üß© **Flexible Pipeline**
  - Combine different preprocessing and fitting methods
  - Customize each step of the analysis process

- üìà **Visualization Tools**
  - Complex plane plots
  - Amplitude and phase plots
  - Residual analysis
  - Method-specific visualization tools

## Installation

```bash
pip install resonfit
```

## Quick Example

```python
from resonfit import ResonatorPipeline
from resonfit.preprocessing import CableDelayCorrector, AmplitudePhaseNormalizer
from resonfit.fitting.methods import DCMFitter
import numpy as np

# Load data
freqs = np.linspace(5e9, 6e9, 1001)
s21 = your_data_loading_function()

# Create pipeline
pipeline = ResonatorPipeline()
pipeline.add_preprocessor(CableDelayCorrector())
pipeline.add_preprocessor(AmplitudePhaseNormalizer())

# Set the fitting method (DCMFitter is available)
pipeline.set_fitter(DCMFitter(weight_bandwidth_scale=1.0))

# Run analysis with comprehensive plots
results = pipeline.run_analysis_and_plot(freqs, s21)

# For a quick run without plots
# results = pipeline.run(freqs, s21, plot=False)

# Print results
print(f"Resonance frequency: {results['fr']/1e9:.6f} GHz")
print(f"Quality factors: Qi={results['Qi']:.0f}, Qc={results['Qc_mag']:.0f}, Ql={results['Ql']:.0f}")
```

## Development Status

ResonFit is currently at version 0.2.0 with all core fitting methods implemented. You can track our progress in the [Development Plan](DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md).
